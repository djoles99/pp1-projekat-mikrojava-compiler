# pp1-projekat-mikrojava-compiler
Compiler for programming language MikroJava (MJ)

School project written in Java by given prog. lang. specifications.

Keyword and functionalities of *namespace* are up there in code but not actively in use,
keyword *range* and *range()* implementation are in use instead (spec. project changes as a task for the terms).

Some code in src files that does not correspond to any MJ prog. lang. specs;
but is infact a modification of MJ spec, done for the sake of exercise e.g. *goto* and square operator *@*.
